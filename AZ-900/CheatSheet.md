### Evolution

* On-Premise: Buy your own hardware
  * Highest start costs
* Dedicated: Rent a machine
  * High start costs
  * Limited to OS
* VMs: Rent a VM on a machine
  * Hypervisor
* Container: 
  * Docker
* Functions:
  * Server-less compute


### Availability zones

* Zonal services: Specific zone
* Zone redundant services: replicates automatically accoss zones
* Non-regional services: ??

* Region: Min 400 miles away
  * Availability zones: Have their own infrastructure
